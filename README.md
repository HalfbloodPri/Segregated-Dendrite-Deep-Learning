Code from ["Towards deep learning with segregated dendrites" by Jordan Guergiuev, Timothy P. Lillicrap, Blake A. Richards.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00161)

See `example_script.py` for an example of loading MNIST, creating a network and training it.

This code requires the [MNIST dataset files](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the code.
